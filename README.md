In the spring of 2021, the most popular App on the global Internet was Clubhouse, a voice social platform that suddenly became popular. With the help of Elon Musk's popularity, this App not only directly rushed to the first place in the App Store application list, but also appeared that the invitation code was in short supply. At present, Clubhouse has more than 2 million users, with a valuation of 1 billion dollars. On the track where strangers socialize in China, the ecological competition is also very fierce. Except for some old entrants, such as Soul, Momo, and Detective, influenced by the social voice boom in overseas markets and the online traffic catalyzed by the epidemic black swan, Tencent, NetEase, Baidu, JD.COM and other giants have also increased the social layout of strangers in recent years. Although there is no explosive product yet, most of them have failed, but no one has given up this traffic field. Thus, the track where strangers socialize has always been in the limelight.

Today, with the high development of technology, real-time media information transmission is no longer so difficult, and it is possible to make use of the existing technology to create a platform that conforms to the national conditions and helps strangers to socialize.

ITalking is developed and innovated based on the existing research results.The platform's short-term positioning, a channel to relieve loneliness; long-term positioning, a platform to express and confide in with confidence.

2. Embracing the value and experience of building genuine connections.

3. Build a strong technology stack to better support the platform.
